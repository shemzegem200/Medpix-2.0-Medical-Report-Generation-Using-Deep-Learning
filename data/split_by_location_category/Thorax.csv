On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis. No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown). On cine bright blood phase contrast imaging at the level of the aortic valve, the aortic valve orifice is noted to be lens shaped (Figure F, arrowheads). Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) confirmed the dilated ascending aortic root and absence of an aortic dissection or coarctation.",Bicuspid Aortic Valve with Aortic Stenosis and Aortic Dilatation.,Ascending Aortic Dilatation: 1) Atheroscloerosis 2) Aortic valvular disease (stenosis and/or insufficiency 3) Collagen vascular disease (e.g. Marfan syndrome) 4) Mycotic aneurysm 5) Aortic dissection,"Figure C. Axial SSFP On DIR FSE images (A, axial; B, sagittal), dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.8 cm is well seen.  This is confirmed on corresponding bright blood images (C, axial; D, sagittal) performed using a steady state free precession pulse sequence.  Ao = ascending aorta Figure D. Sagittal SSFP On DIR FSE images (A, axial; B, sagittal), dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.8 cm is well seen.  This is confirmed on corresponding bright blood images (C, axial; D, sagittal) performed using a steady state free precession pulse sequence.  Ao = ascending aorta Figure G. Oblique axial SSFP Figure G.  Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA, performed during the arterial phase of a 0.2 mmol/kg dose of a Gadolinium-chelate contrast bolus injection administered via a right antecubital vein at 2 mL/sec, demonstrates a dilated ascending aorta but no evidence of intimal tear.  Note that there is suggestion of an aortic narrowing of the distal arch.  However, there was no flow jet seen across the region on cine bright blood imaging (Figures D and E) or dilated collateral vessels—features that would invariably be present if there was a hemodynamically significant coarctation of the aorta. Figure A. Axial Double IR FSE On DIR FSE images (A, axial; B, sagittal), dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.8 cm is well seen.  This is confirmed on corresponding bright blood images (C, axial; D, sagittal) performed using a steady state free precession pulse sequence.  Ao = ascending aorta Figure B. Sagittal Double IR FSE On DIR FSE images (A, axial; B, sagittal), dilation of the ascending aorta to 4.8 cm is well seen.  This is confirmed on corresponding bright blood images (C, axial; D, sagittal) performed using a steady state free precession pulse sequence.  Ao = ascending aorta","On axial (Figure A) and sagittal (Figure B) black blood DIR FSE images, the patient is noted to have a dilated ascending aorta, which measures approximately 48 mm in diameter. Steady state free precession is a relatively newer MR pulse sequence that provides good homogeneity of the bright blood pool signal and confirms the aortic dilatation noted on black blood images (Figures C and D). On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta.

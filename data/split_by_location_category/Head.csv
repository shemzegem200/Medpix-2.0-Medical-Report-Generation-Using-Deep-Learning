Axial CT demonstrates a well defined extra-axial cystic lesion deep within a sulci of the left temporal lobe with no surrounding edema. Sagittal T1 weighted image through the parafalcine brain demonstrates an additional cystic lesion along the high convexity that was not appreciated during CT evaluation. No surrounding edema is present, however, a soft tissue nodule is seen in the inferior aspect of the cyst. Axial T2 weighted image through the frontal lobes verifies the cystic nature and associated edema of the intra-axial lesion seen on initial CT evaluation. Axial T2 weighted image through the brain verifies the cystic nature of the extra-axial lesion seen along the right temporal lobe on initial CT evaluation. No surrounding increased T2 signal is present, confirming the abscence of edema. An internal nodule is again noted. Axial post-contrast T1 weighted image with fat saturation technique shows rim enhancement of the intraparenchymal lesion in the left frontal lobe. Axial post-contrast T1 weighted image with fat saturation technique shows no enhancement of the lesion along the left temporal lobe."

Cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in these two regions was relatively normal; however, within the centers of the two wedge-shaped areas of abnormal perfusion there were small areas of decreased blood volume. The summary tissue at risk map indicates a small region of core infarct with a larger region of penumbra. CT angiogram of the neck and head demonstrated no proximal occlusion to the anterior or posterior circulation. MRI performed 6 days later demonstrates subacute infarct in the region of ischemia noted acutely with increased flair and diffusion-weighted signal in the area of interest. Axial CT angiography maximal intensity projection demonstrates no proximal small vessel occlusion.  Incidentally noted absence of the right A1 segment.  No large region of asymmetry in the M3 distribution."

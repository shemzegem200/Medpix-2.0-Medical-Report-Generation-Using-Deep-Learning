Axial post-contrast T1 weighted image with fat saturation technique shows no enhancement of the lesion along the left temporal lobe.","CT and MR evaluation of the brain demonstrated multiple well-defined cystic lesions in the brain parenchyma and subarachnoid spaces. All lesions were approximately 1cm in size and several appeared to have a small internal nodule. Only one of the lesions (an intra-axial cyst in the frontal lobe) demonstrated any surrounding edema. Axial CT through the level of the frontal lobes demonstrates a well defined intra-axial cystic lesion with a surrounding rim of edema. Axial CT demonstrates a well defined extra-axial cystic lesion deep within a sulci of the left temporal lobe with no surrounding edema. Sagittal T1 weighted image through the parafalcine brain demonstrates an additional cystic lesion along the high convexity that was not appreciated during CT evaluation. No surrounding edema is present, however, a soft tissue nodule is seen in the inferior aspect of the cyst. Axial T2 weighted image through the frontal lobes verifies the cystic nature and associated edema of the intra-axial lesion seen on initial CT evaluation. Axial T2 weighted image through the brain verifies the cystic nature of the extra-axial lesion seen along the right temporal lobe on initial CT evaluation. No surrounding increased T2 signal is present, confirming the abscence of edema. An internal nodule is again noted. Axial post-contrast T1 weighted image with fat saturation technique shows rim enhancement of the intraparenchymal lesion in the left frontal lobe. Axial post-contrast T1 weighted image with fat saturation technique shows no enhancement of the lesion along the left temporal lobe."

The brest tissue was heterogenously dense. Patient underwent routine screeing breast MR which demonstrates a small enhancing mass within the mid right breast, 12:00 position. There is minimal associated T2 hyperintensity, but this involves more the periphery of the lesion, rather than the substance of the lesion itslef. No other discordant foci of abnormal enhancement were present within either breast. The patient was recalled for subsequent right breast ultrasound. This demonstrates an angulated, hypoechoic 5mm mass in at the 12:00 position, zone 1a. Subsequent ultrasound-guided 14ga core biopsy was performed. This is a subtracted sagittal image from a dynamic enanced MR sequence.  Note enhancing nodule/mass at 12:00 in the central right breast.

Because this patient has also had radiation therapy, the differential diagnosis includes: residual tumor, recurrent tumor, and radiation changes.","Initial multiple MR images demonstrate a ring-enhancing lesion in the site of glioma, previously treated with radiation therapy, with some areas of nodular changes. MR spectroscopy of normal site, TE = 144 msec, which demonstrates prominent N-acetylaspartate (NAA) peak at the 2.0 ppm, which is the normal neuronal marker. Creatine peak at 3.0 ppm and choline peak at 3.2 ppm are also demonstrated, showing normal relationships. MR spectroscopy of the abnormal site, TE = 144 msec, which demonstrates elevation of the choline peak, and the suppression of the NAA peak, along with an inverted peak at the 1.0-1.2 ppm, which is the lactate peak (which characteristically inverts at TE = 144 msec). These findings suggest tumor recurrence with some areas of necrosis, rather than radiation-induced changes.
